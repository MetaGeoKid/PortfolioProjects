# PortfolioProjects

Hello! Thank you for stopping by to look at some of my favorite projects I have been working on to show my data analysis skills.

In CovidProject.sql you will find a variety of queries that look through data from ______ to show death rates and vaccination rates
throughout the world. I created a few views too to show connect them through Tableau to visualize...

In DataCleaningNashvilleHousing I cleaned what was an Excel file through SQL means. I created new columns by combinging data from
other columns, modify columns to make it easier to write queries, and deleted redundant columns.
